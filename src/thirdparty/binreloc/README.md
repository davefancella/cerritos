binreloc
========

A maintaining repository for `autopackage.org`'s binreloc.c

About
-----

The `autopackage.org` project aimed at providing a toolset for creation
of self installing applications for the Linux operating system. Due
to the popularity, and obvious benefits of using centralized package
managers the project went defunct a few months ago. Unfortunately their
website and SVN went down as well. Which is a bit sad, because there were
a few gems in their code. Like `binreloc.c`.

This repository maintains a copy of `binreloc.c` and maybe the one or
another maintenance work will be done on it.

License and Authorship
----------------------

The original license of `binreloc.c` was *Public Domain*. Unfortunately
some (many) jurisdictions don't recognize *Public Domain* work, in which
case a default authorship copyright is assumed.

Hence this repository will run under the WTFPL, which is as close as it
gets to public domain, but due to explicit "terms and conditions" should
be legally sound also in jurisdictions without a concept of public domain.
