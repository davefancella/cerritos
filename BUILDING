How to build cerritos

1.  Install dependencies
Linux (package names may vary), in Terminal:
> {your packager} libsdl2 doxygen graphviz libsdl2-image-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev freealut-dev

macOS:
Get XCode: https://developer.apple.com/support/xcode/
Get Homebrew via https://brew.sh/; then, in Terminal:
> brew install sdl2 doxygen graphviz sdl2_image sdl2_ttf freealut

Windows:
Install Visual Studio, for example the 2022 Community Edition: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/de/vs/community/
Only the C++ Desktop Development package should be required.
In cmd (all a bit more involved as Windows is lacking some basic tools):
> winget install Git.Git
> winget install cmake
> winget install python
optional: Visual Studio Code editor, not required for building:
> winget install code

disable python alias via Settings -> Manage App Execution Aliases (use search)
DO NOT install Microsoft store version of python, its path settings seem broken

In Git Bash (installed with git), install pip (https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)
> py -m ensurepip --upgrade
then install conan over pip (https://docs.conan.io/en/2.0/installation.html):
> pip install 'conan<2.0' --upgrade

Cross Compilation:
Look at the scripts and documentation in the crosscompile directory

2.  Create build directory
> mkdir build
> cd build

3: Get Dependencies via Conan (Optional on Linux and macOS if nothing went wrong in step 1, required on Windows):
> conan install .. --build=missing

4.  Run cmake
> cmake ..

5.  Build!
> cmake --build .
