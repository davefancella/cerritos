# This file contains a description of SDL event types that's used
# to generate cerritos event classes as well as the case statements
# used in the sdl backend to translate from SDl->cerritos events
#
# Format is simple:
# SDL_EVENT_TYPE: <member for event type in sdl event union>
#     <cerritos membername>(type, constructor argument): <sdl member name>
#
# The cerritos event class will be generated with a default constructor
# and an overloaded constructor that takes all the SDL event data and
# initializes the cerritos event

# An event generated whenever there's a quit reason
